Alongside Amy Kimberly Beauty, who does make up, waxing and facials we believe we covered all of the bases.

As an integral part of the patient care team, you will be asked to think quickly on your feet to ensure that patients are comfortable during their therapy sessions while connecting with them to provide a customer service experience like no other. The secret to success at ATI is to exceed customer expectations by providing the highest quality of care in a friendly and encouraging environment and you are on the front lines of delivery. Our core values of quality of care, teamwork, communication and the friendly factor show in your attitude and day to day interaction with everyone you meet. Your Purpose at ATI:
To be that memorable moment--partnering with the teams both in the clinic and corporate to ensure that every patient receives the care and attention that they will rave about to their friends and families. This is accomplished by emotionally investing and engaging with patients as well as teammates to understand and meet their needs.

The plus side of receiving treatment in an ATI clinic is that they can also expect to enjoy coming to therapy because of our friendly and encouraging environment.
What’s cool about this job?
You will be part of a strong internal team focused on taking care of our patients including the following:
Your days will be busy as a champion of ATI's culture and values, working alongside all members of the clinic team to make a positive difference in patients’ lives with each and every interaction while working in a friendly and encouraging environment.
This is the opportunity to join the best and fastest growing Physical Therapy Company in the world while learning great skills that will help your personal and professional growth.
You will receive excellent development from your on-site Clinic Director and as well as an off-site Office Manager as you receive the training and support needed to master the Patient Service Specialist role.
Have true fun and partnership by participating in patient graduation celebrations, local charity days, dress up days and showing your ATI spirit to the patients, team and community.
What you need to be successful:
Excellent customer service skills with the ability to multitask and set multiple priorities while providing an exceptional experience for anyone that enters the clinic.
