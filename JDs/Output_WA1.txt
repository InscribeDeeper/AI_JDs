As an integral part of the patient care team, you will be asked to think quickly on your feet to ensure that patients are comfortable during their therapy sessions while connecting with them to provide a customer service experience like no other. The secret to success at ATI is to exceed customer expectations by providing the highest quality of care in a friendly and encouraging environment and you are on the front lines of delivery. Our core values of quality of care, teamwork, communication and the friendly factor show in your attitude and day to day interaction with everyone you meet. Your Purpose at ATI:
To be that memorable moment--partnering with the teams both in the clinic and corporate to ensure that every patient receives the care and attention that they will rave about to their friends and families. This is accomplished by emotionally investing and engaging with patients as well as teammates to understand and meet their needs. Our patients want to feel better physically, have a clinic that can accommodate their schedule, be assured that we can get all necessary authorizations and that we can load their information accurately in our billing system to ensure clean and accurate insurance claims and patient statements. The plus side of receiving treatment in an ATI clinic is that they can also expect to enjoy coming to therapy because of our friendly and encouraging environment.
What’s cool about this job?
You will be part of a strong internal team focused on taking care of our patients including the following:
Your days will be busy as a champion of ATI's culture and values, working alongside all members of the clinic team to make a positive difference in patients’ lives with each and every interaction while working in a friendly and encouraging environment.
This is the opportunity to join the best and fastest growing Physical Therapy Company in the world while learning great skills that will help your personal and professional growth.
You will receive excellent development from your on-site Clinic Director and as well as an off-site Office Manager as you receive the training and support needed to master the Patient Service Specialist role.
Have true fun and partnership by participating in patient graduation celebrations, local charity days, dress up days and showing your ATI spirit to the patients, team and community.
What you need to be successful:
Excellent customer service skills with the ability to multitask and set multiple priorities while providing an exceptional experience for anyone that enters the clinic.
The ability to communicate effectively and professionally with everyone you interact with from patient to teammate to clinical leadership.
Demonstrate enthusiasm, compassion and the friendly factor to make the day of our patients.
Excellent telephone rapport building skills as well as strong computer skills to effectively assist our patients.
Ability to work closely with all clinic staff to improve work relationships, build morale, increase productivity and create a world-class clinical team.
Ability to stand, stoop, and move throughout the clinic for your entire assigned shift.

About Metropolitan Grill
The moment you step inside Metropolitan Grill, you will know you have entered a classic steakhouse. Rich in tradition, The Met is housed inside the historic Marion Building, which dates to 1903.
At The Met, the focus is on Prime beef. We built our reputation on the classics: filet mignon, New York peppercorn steak, Delmonico, porterhouse and Chateaubriand carved tableside. Corporate Chef Eric Hellner hand-selects each cut of Prime Double R Ranch beef from Washington State and American Wagyu from Idaho. We have even developed proprietary seasonings for our beef. Steaks are then seared over the high heat of imported mesquite charcoal, ensuring the most tender, juicy flavor.
Our award-winning wine list showcases a definitive steakhouse selection of premium West Coast red wines, with an emphasis on Cabernet, Merlot and Meritage. The Met’s cellar has received national recognition, including the Wine Spectator “Best of Award of Excellence.”
One of the reasons for The Met’s ongoing success is the dedication of the professional staff, which takes great pride in providing every guest with an exceptional dining experience.
